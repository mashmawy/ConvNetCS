# ConvNetCS
 
ConvNetCS Library is a .net c# Convolution neural network library along with expermintal deepQlearning implementation, based on Andrej Karpathy Convnetj. 
the network can be built from several layers including :
  - Full Connected Layer
  - Dropout Layer
  - Convolution Layer
  - Local Response Normalization
  - Max Pool Layer
  - Maxout Layer (Activation Layer)
  - Relu Layer    (Activation Layer)
  - Sigmoid Layer (Activation Layer)
  - Regression Layer (Loss Layer) 
  - SVM Layer 	(Loss Layer)
  - Softmax Layer (Loss Layer)


# Pretrained Models

  -  [VGG16 for imagenet dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=116hIPVRlaKx8fpFBcY_AL2jElAEKE0Sa) 
-  [VGG16 for PLaces365 dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=116hIPVRlaKx8fpFBcY_AL2jElAEKE0Sa)

Load pretrained  models from PlayWithVGG project and start visulaize features.

# Notes!
  - The project target x64 cpu by default.
  - run without debuging to boost the performance.
  - all the pretrained models is converted from the original caffe model and the licence of the original author is applied.
